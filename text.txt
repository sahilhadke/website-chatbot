Computer science allows for up to three opportunities for students to take Curricular Practical Training while completing their degree.
Program description
Degree awarded: MS  Computer Science
The MS program in computer science prepares students to undertake fundamental and applied research in computing.
The program welcomes motivated and dedicated students to work with world-class faculty on projects across the field of computing and augmented intelligence. Students may choose a thesis or nonthesis option as their culminating event. Students can study topics such as:
artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical modeling
big data and data mining
computational biology
computer design and architecture, including nonvolatile memory computing
computer system security, cybersecurity and cryptography
cyber-physical systems, IoT and robotics
distributed computing and consensus protocols
networking and computer systems
novel computing paradigms (e.g., biocomputing, quantum computation)
social computing
theory, algorithms and optimization
visualization and graphics
STEM-OPT for international students on F-1 visas
This program may be eligible for an Optional Practical Training extension for up to 36 months. This OPT work authorization term may help international students gain skills and experience in the U.S. Those interested in an OPT extension should review ASU degrees that qualify for the STEM-OPT extension at ASU's International Students and Scholars Center website.
The OPT extension only applies to students on an F-1 visa and does not apply to students completing the degree through ASU Online.

Accelerated program options
This program allows students to obtain both a bachelor's and master's degree in as little as five years. It is offered as an accelerated bachelor's plus master's degree with:
Computer Science, BS
Computer Science (Cybersecurity), BS
Computer Science (Software Engineering), BS
Computer Systems Engineering, BSE
Computer Systems Engineering (Cybersecurity), BSE
Software Engineering, BS
Acceptance to the graduate program requires a separate application. Students typically receive approval to pursue the accelerated master’s during the junior year of their bachelor's degree program. Interested students can learn about eligibility requirements and how to apply.
Degree requirements

Electives (15 or 21 credit hours)
Culminating Experience (0 or 6 credit hours)
CSE 599 Thesis (6) or
portfolio (0)
Additional Curriculum Information
Students should see the academic unit for the list of courses approved for each core area in applications, foundations and systems. Courses selected as part of the core may not be used as other elective coursework on the same plan of study.
Students complete a thesis or portfolio for the culminating experience. Students in the thesis option take 15 credit hours of electives, and students in the portfolio option take 21 credit hours of electives. MS program students who select project portfolio as their culminating event must complete a project portfolio from two courses in which the student received a "B" grade (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher. Students should see the academic unit for additional information and requirements.
For thesis students, nine of the 15 credit hours of electives must be courses in a chosen research area and approved by the student's academic advisor. Up to six credit hours can be independent study in CSE 590 Reading and Conference.
Students complete a minimum of 30 credit hours for the program. At least 24 of these credit hours must be 500-level CSE courses at ASU. Up to six credit hours of 400-level courses may be applied to the plan of study.
Admission requirements
Applicants must fulfill the requirements of both the Graduate College and the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering.
Applicants are eligible to apply to the program if they have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, computer engineering or a closely related area from a regionally accredited institution.
Applicants must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 (scale is 4.00 = "A") in the last 60 hours of their first bachelor's degree program, or a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 (scale is 4.00 = "A") in an applicable master's degree program.
All applicants must submit:
graduate admission application and application fee
official transcripts
GRE scores
a statement of purpose
proof of English proficiency
Additional Application Information
An applicant whose native language is not English must provide proof of English proficiency regardless of their current residency.
If the student has graduated with an undergraduate degree in computer science or computer systems engineering from ASU, GRE scores are not required. ASU does not accept the GRE® General Test at home edition.
Students assigned any deficiency coursework upon admission must complete those classes with a grade of "C" (scale is 4.00 = "A") or higher within two semesters of admission to the program. Deficiency courses include:
CSE 230 Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming
CSE 310 Data Structures and Algorithms
CSE 330 Operating Systems
CSE 340 Principles of Programming Languages or CSE 355 Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science
The applicant's undergraduate GPA and depth of preparation in computer science and engineering are the primary factors affecting admission.
Tuition information
When it comes to paying for higher education, everyone’s situation is different. Students can learn about ASU tuition and financial aid options to find out which will work best for them.
